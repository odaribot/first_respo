							<h2>What I Want to Be </h2>
							<p>The job i want to do in a future is  <strong>Software Developer/Engineer.</strong></p>
							<section><P> As a first-year student preparing for a career in the software field, I have begun actively researching the skills, tools, and technologies that are in high demand in today’s job market. I am learning programming languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript, which are widely used in various areas of software development. I’m also exploring different branches of the field, including web development, mobile app development, artificial intelligence, and data science, to better understand where my interests and strengths lie. Alongside my academic studies, I plan to take part in online courses, coding challenges, and beginner-level projects to build practical experience. I believe that starting early and staying curious will help me develop a solid foundation and be well-prepared for future opportunities such as internships and entry-level roles in the software industry.</P>

        <p>
          I have a wide range of hobbies that reflect my creativity, curiosity, and love for exploration. One of my biggest passions is music. I enjoy listening to different genres as it helps me to stay motivated and feel connected to my emotions. It gives me a powerful outlet to express my thoughts and feelings in a creative way.
          Another hobby I deeply enjoy is writing poems. I find poetry to be a beautiful and meaningful form of self-expression that allows me to capture moments, emotions, and ideas through words.
          In addition to creative writing, I have a strong interest in learning new things — whether it’s exploring a new topic online, picking up a new skill, or simply reading about something unfamiliar. I enjoy challenging myself to grow and expand my knowledge.
          Traveling is another activity I truly love. Visiting new places, experiencing different cultures, and meeting new people excites me and gives me a broader perspective on life. It also fuels my creativity and often inspires my writing.
          Lastly, I enjoy playing games in my free time.
